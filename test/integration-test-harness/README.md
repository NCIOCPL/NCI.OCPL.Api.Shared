# Integration Test Harness

This project doesn't create an API as a deliverable artifact.

In order to do integration testing of the shared API components,
we have to create one specifically for testing.

Note also that this test harness is _only_ for API components as
there's really no integration per se for the testing components,
save to use them in actual tests.
